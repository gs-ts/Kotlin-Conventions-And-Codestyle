# Kotlin Conventions and Codestyle guidelines
This repo presents some conventions and codestyle guidelines with Android application development in mind.

Order of public and private functions in Classes:
1. First, the implementation of interface and abstract classes if any 
2. Second, the public functions at the top of the class
3. Finally, the private functions at the bottom of the class, with the same order that are used in public functions
Example:
```
class AccountViewModel {

  init {
  }

  fun on 
}
```
